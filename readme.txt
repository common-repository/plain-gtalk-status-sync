Show your GTalk status on your WordPress blog.

== Description ==

This plugin will automatically show your GTalk status on your WordPress blog. You can set a max-shown number and the cache interval to make it works more smoothly.

FYI:The principle of this plugin is to refine your GTalk badge page, which is the only way to fetch your GTalk status information. Google did not provide any open API for GTalk status and it seems there would be no official API for a while.

== Installation ==

1. Unzip the zip package in your plugin folder
2. Activate it in your wp-admin menu :)
3. Go to the settings page for tips in details, it's very easy.
4. Simply put a &lt;?php get_gtalk_status();?&gt; in your theme file to show it. Don't forget to use a &lt;ol&gt; or &lt;ol&gt; to wrap it!
